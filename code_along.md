# Code-Alongs Cultural Data Science - Visual #
All scripts are in `src/` and notebooks in `examples/`. Scripts for each lesson is sorted according to importance for the course element.

#### Lesson 1 ####
- `load_display_save.py`
- `getting_and_setting.py`
- `translation.py`
- `drawing.py`

##### Comments:
- basic display functionalities from `OpenCV` do not work on ipynb, e.g., `imshow` and `waitKey`
- `drawing.py` by itself does not allow to visually understand the contents of an image using OpenCV, these operations allow students to draw Regions of Interest (ROIs) surrounding objects in an image.
- `drawing.py` is also relevant for students that need to draw and manipulate simple shapes in Python, for instance students that use PsychoPy to run behavioral experiments
- `translation.py` introduces the concept of matrix manipulation with a translation matrix, it is explained in `lessons_1.ipynb` 'Digression 1.3.1: Translation matrix'.

#### Lesson 2 ####
- `splitting_and_merging.py`
- `colorspace.py`
- `grayscale_histogram.py`
- `color_histograms.py`
- `masking.py`

##### Comments:
- reverse color format (BGR) explained: https://learnopencv.com/why-does-opencv-use-bgr-color-format/
